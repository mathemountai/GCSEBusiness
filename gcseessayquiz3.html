          "Because social media is free, it leads to guaranteed profit. Therefore, it is risk-free. However, it may distract staff.",
          "Because social media can target audiences directly, it leads to more cost-effective marketing. Therefore, the business may see a better return on investment. However, it requires regular content to remain effective.",

          "Because good service creates a good impression, it leads to brand awareness. Therefore, people will remember it. However, memory doesn't always lead to sales.",
          "Because good customer service builds trust, it leads to repeat custom and loyalty. Therefore, the business can grow more sustainably. However, training staff may be costly and time-consuming.",
          "Because friendly staff help, it leads to nice customers. Therefore, working is easier. However, some customers are rude."

          "Because market research gives exact answers, it leads to perfect decisions. Therefore, the business will never fail. However, overconfidence could be dangerous.",

        options: [
          "Because e-commerce is online, it leads to global domination. Therefore, all businesses should do it. However, not all do.",
          "Because e-commerce reduces physical store costs, it leads to higher margins. Therefore, profits can improve. However, tech setup and maintenance may be expensive.",
          "Because customers buy online, it leads to clicks. Therefore, sales rise. However, clicking is not always buying."
